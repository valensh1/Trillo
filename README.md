## Knowledge Gained From This Project

* Flexbox - This project focused on creating a modern website with the primary focus of using flexbox. Flexbox properties used throughout project included justify-content, align-items, align-content, flex-direction, flex-basis, flex-grow, flex-wrap, order, etc.

* CSS architecture: Usage of the BEM methodology.   

* CSS variables - usage of variables to eliminate repeating code and also making it easier to make adjustments in future with just one change.

* Background Images - usage of linear gradient backgrounds.

* SVG - usage of svg elements which is the more modern way of displaying images in your websites. SVG's cut down on generating multiple HTTP server requests triggered by individual icon fonts and also allows greater flexibility into editing, coloring and animating icons.

* Mask-image - usage of the mask-image CSS property which allows you to show portions of a background image viewed only through a transparent svg icon. The pinkish arrows in this project under the hotel details section is an example of where mask-image was used on this project. 

* Animations - Advanced CSS animations with @keyframes, animation and transition.

* Modern responsive design - Using media queries to adjust design for different screen sizes.
